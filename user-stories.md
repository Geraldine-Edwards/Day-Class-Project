## Age Restriction Handling

This platform is designed to support **adults aged 18 and over only**. The following measures are in place to manage access responsibly:

### Age Gate Process

- Users must actively confirm they are 18 or older during sign-up or before screening.
- If a user selects ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to being over 18:
  - No account is created.
  - No data is stored.
  - The user is redirected to a public information page with appropriate child/youth support links.

### Suggested Redirect Page Message

> ### This Service Is for Adults (18+) Only
>
> Unfortunately, this website is intended for adults only.  
> If you're under 18 and need help, you're not alone ‚Äî here are some places you can turn to:
>
> - üìû **Childline** ‚Äì 0800 1111 (Free, confidential 24/7 helpline)
> - üåç **The Mix** ‚Äì [themix.org.uk](https://www.themix.org.uk) (Support for under-25s)
> - üè° **Local Authority Social Services**
>
> If you are in immediate danger, call **999** or visit your nearest **A&E**.

### Responsibility & Limitations

- Users may still misrepresent their age. This is common and difficult to prevent.
- The site mitigates this by:
  - Being explicit in its Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
  - Preventing underage users from proceeding beyond the age gate.
  - Not collecting data from under-18s.
